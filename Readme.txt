GECK Sound Converter v1.0

This program will extract any Sound Archives for the selected game and convert the files for use within the GECK.
Since the games ship with mostly .ogg files and we can't link these files directly in the GECK, I have made a converter so that you can easily convert all the files for linking in the GECK to new Sound records etc.

When packaging your mod you do not need to include the .wav files that the tool spits out (unless they are custom made or edited) since the game will just read the .ogg files from the games archives.

Supported Games:
Fallout 3
Fallout New Vegas

I may add support for other games in the future.

Instructions:
Run the program in any directory. Choose the game you would like to use and the tool will do everything for you. Please note the process may take a while depending on your hardware and the amount of Sound Archives you have for your game.

When the tool is complete you will see "Process Complete!". Press any key and the program will close.
